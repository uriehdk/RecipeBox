The server backend will be handling all database interactions
for the webpage, as well as user authentication. The to-do list
for functionality is:

- User authentication
    - Register new users
    - Login existing users
- Recipe database
    - CRUD operations on recipes
    - Assign recipes to authors
    - Public/private recipes
    - Like counter on recipes
    - Comments?

SQL will likely be used for the database, unless a particular
NoSQL database seems to fit the deal better. MongoDB is a
candidate.
